Epilepsy is a common phenomenon formed by abnormal discharges between neurons in the brain, and epileptic seizures are a clinical manifestation of abnormal hypersynchronized paroxysmal electrical activity of neurons in the brain. EEG can record epileptiform discharge activity such as spike, sharp, spike-slow complex and spike-slow complex waves during seizures or interictal periods in epileptic patients.
In the interictal period, the EEG signal is transient waveforms that appear as spike or spiking waves, and the EEG signal of a seizure is continuous with a compound waveform of spike and spiking waves. Interictal epileptiform discharges and unilateral periodic epileptiform discharges are of definite value for diagnosis. Spike and sharp waves are mainly used to confirm the presence of epileptic disorders, and spike and slow waves, and sharp and slow waves are usually used to determine whether epilepsy has occurred or not. Therefore, clarifying the waveform, amplitude, frequency, and other characteristics of epileptic EEG signals is of great value and clinical significance for the study of epilepsy auto-detection.
We use F to denote epilepsy not occurring and T to denote epilepsy occurring, and in the following four EEG signal images, the first three images are categorized as T, T, F, and F in that order.
Thinking step-by-step, based on the above domain-specific neuroscience knowledge and other examples, note the channel information reflected in the figure and categorize the EEG signals in the fourth image as F or T.
In any case, even if you are unable to give a precise judgment, the last sentence of the answer must strictly follow the following format: the image is categorized as “F” or “T”.
